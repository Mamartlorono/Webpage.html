<header><h2>Reconnecting With The Natural Voice</h2></header>
<p>I want to reconnect with the power of my natural, authentic voice</p>
<p>Freeing my natural voice is a path tha leads to reconnectinng with my authentic self, which is what I've been trying to do for more than two decades living in the Philipines.</p>

<p>I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy, overcoming social anxiety, taking voice lessons,singing lessongs,advance public speaking,Communication and acting classes,dating and pickingup, meetups,festival,social clubs.none of these activities got me the result and fulfillment I was seeking.

<p>After being on a radical journey of spiritual transformation over the past three years I realized what I've been trying to do this whole time is to be my self.I've trying to reconnect with a sense of self that I've lose since I moved to the Philipines.
